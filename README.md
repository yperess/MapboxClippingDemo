# Mapbox Clipping Demo

This app demonstrates the clipping affect seen on mapbox. Note that it requires a very particular 
zoom and a while to find the correct orientation.

## Requirements
* This project builds with Kotlin
* This project requires the use of a mapbox access token to be added to the `local.properties` file
via: `mapbox.accessToken`
